## Description

This web app functions as a launching point for creating a portfolio for me to showcase my skills as a web developer.  It contains a standard header with nav links, an image of me at my best (in the mountains!), along with some associated text and second contact me link.  There are 3 sections following the background image.  The first is an about me detailing some information about my professional and private life.  The second is a link to previously developed web apps, with an emphasis on the most recent one.  Lastly, there is a contact me section with links to my LinkedIn, email, phone number, and Github.

This challenge put me through a wide range of mental states.  Everything from extreme frustration getting stuck for an extended period of time on a typo, to immense liberation when I crossed hurdles that I didn't even know were possible.  This project has let me experience what others told me I would experience as a developer.  Overall, it was quite a rewarding and fun experience.

## Technology

Microsoft's VS Code was the programming platform used to create this portfolio page.  GitBash was used for version control for the repository.  A GitHub repository was utilized for version control, as well as provide a streamlined deployment to GitHub Pages.  Images were edited using MS Paint.
