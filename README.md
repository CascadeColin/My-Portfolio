## Description

This web app functions as a launching point for creating a portfolio for me to showcase my skills as a web developer. It contains a standard header with nav links, an image of me at my best (in the mountains!), along with some associated text and second contact me link. There are 3 sections following the background image. The first is an about me detailing some information about my professional and private life. The second is a link to previously developed web apps, with an emphasis on the most recent one. Lastly, there is a contact me section with links to my LinkedIn, email, phone number, and Github.  The web app also has media queries that enable it to function on tablets and phones.

This challenge put me through a wide range of mental states. Everything from extreme frustration getting stuck for an extended period of time on a typo, to immense liberation when I crossed hurdles that I didn't even know were possible. This project has let me experience what others told me I would experience as a developer. Overall, it was quite a rewarding and fun experience.
