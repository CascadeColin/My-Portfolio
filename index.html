          I am a full-stack web developer located in Seattle, WA. My journey as
          a developer began in 2022 after rediscovering my love for how
          computers and technology function. I previously took two semesters of
          computer science at Arizona State University in 2008, primarily coding
          in Java. Life took me in a different direction, but I eventually found
          my way back to tech!<br /><br />

                This website is an unofficial extension of the Steam Client.  Creating a new account automatically saves all of their games and achievements, given they provide
                a working Steam ID.  The website has features that pick a random game for them to play, as well as going for a random achievement they don't already have.  It also has a feedback system where users can leave comments about their experiences obtaining achievements for their Steam games.
