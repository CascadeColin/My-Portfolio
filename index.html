        <p class="container">
          I am a full-stack web developer located in Seattle, WA. My journey as
          a developer began in 2022 after rediscovering my love for how
          computers and technology function. I previously took two semesters of
          computer science at Arizona State University in 2008, primarily coding
          in Java. Life took me in a different direction, but I eventually found
          my way back to tech!<br /><br />

          When I am not in front of a screen, I love to get out into nature.
          Seattle provides me with world-class opportunities for me to
          experience the endless beauty of the wilderness (as well as access to
          tech-minded people). I have recently gotten into board games,
          especially social deduction games, and have an ongoing love for 4x
          strategy video games. Currently, most of my gaming time is dedicated
          to Terra Invicta.
